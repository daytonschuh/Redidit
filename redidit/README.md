# Redidit

## Introduction
  Inspired by Reddit, this is a complete overhaul of a previously completed project: <a href="https://www.github.com/daytonschuh/MockReddit">MockReddit</a>.
  The previous design did not provide ease of use for the end user. Redidit is not built for server deployment, but makes exploration of the APIs prettier and easier to view as an end user. 

## Tech Stack
  - Python
  - Flask
  - Flask_Login
  - Sqlite
  
## Running the Project

  - Change to the appropriate directory ```cd Redidit```
  - Use the command ```flask run```
  - Open your browser of choice and go to ```localhost:5000```<br>
  ***Work In Progress***
